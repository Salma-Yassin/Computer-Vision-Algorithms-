# Computer Vision Algorithms

This GitHub repository contains implementations of some computer vision algorithms in python. These notebooks were developed as part of a computer vision course assignments, and include:

- Canny edge detection algorithm
- Harris corner detection algorithm
- Logo blending algorithm for images and live camera stream 


## Algorithms

### Canny Edge Detection

The Canny edge detection algorithm is a popular edge detection algorithm that uses a multi-stage process to detect edges in an image. The algorithm involves smoothing the image, finding the gradient of the image, performing non-maximum suppression to thin the edges, and applying hysteresis thresholding to detect strong and weak edges.

### Harris Corner Detection

Harris corner detection is a popular algorithm for detecting corners in an image. The algorithm involves computing the gradient of the image, computing the structure tensor at each pixel, and then using the structure tensor to determine if a pixel is a corner or not.
